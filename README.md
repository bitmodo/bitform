# Bitform
Bitform is a framework for Node.js designed make creating websites quickly and easily.
Bitform doesn't use the design that frameworks typically use.
Instead, it opts to use a different design aimed to make everything interchangeable and easy to develop.

One of the big parts of Bitform is interoperability.
It splits much of the different content into separate modules.
These modules provide pages, logic, and configuration options.
For example, you could get a module that provides an entire forum, rather than having to build it yourself or using some external forum software.

Bitform eliminates a lot of the repetitive tasks of making a new website by either including them in Bitform itself or by providing pre-made modules that provide the functionality.
For example, a module included with Bitform provides user functionality and another one provides login and register screens.
By moving these features to reusable modules, we can increase security and ease-of-use as a community.
Not only that, but making websites is much quicker when using pre-made modules.
